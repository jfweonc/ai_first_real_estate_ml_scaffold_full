# Project Goals & SLOs
- Reliable, idempotent ETL and image indexing.
- Reproducible datasets and models with time-aware CV.
- Monitoring with MAE/coverage targets and safe auto-optimization.
- Cost-aware prompts: compact, delta-only, contracts-first.
SLOs: ETL success ≥ 99%, model coverage 90%±2%, rollback < 1h.
